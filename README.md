# Problem Description

Building digital maps is challenging, and maintaining it up to date in an ever-changing world is even more challenging. Various machine learning techniques helps us to detect road signs and changes in real world, and process it to update maps.

Dataset provided here has details on camera sign was detected, Angle of sign with respect to front in degrees, Sign's reported bounding box aspect ratio (width/height), Sign Width and Height, and the target feature Sign Facing, which is where the sign is actually facing.

Goal here is to predict where the sign is actually facing with respect to the vehicle, given above set of inputs.

**Random Forest Classifier** is used to train the model.
